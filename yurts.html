                    <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has
                        canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
                    <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                        The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                        cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
                    <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                    <dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable
                        walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd>
